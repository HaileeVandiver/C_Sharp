# C_Sharp
 These are some projects I made using C# and .NET Framework 
 
 ## Projects: 
  * Car Insurance
  * Twenty One Game
 
 ## Car Insurance 
 This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued. 
 
 ## Twenty One Game 
 This project is a C# console app that allows you to play a game of black jack. You can add multiple players and create custom rules. There are features to calculate and keep track of betting.
